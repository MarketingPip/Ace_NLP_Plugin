# Ace Editor with NLP Highlighting Plugin

This project demonstrates how to use [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), an embeddable code editor, with NLP (Natural Language Processing) annotations. The editor highlights different types of entities (e.g., person, place, organization) using a lightweight NLP library, such as [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise), and custom highlighting rules.

## Features

* **Ace Editor**: Embeds the Ace code editor in the webpage.
* **NLP Entity Recognition**: Highlights entities like dates, persons, places, organizations, emails, currencies, and more.
* **Custom Highlighting**: You can define custom patterns for various types of entities.
* **Modular Imports**: Uses ES modules to import the necessary libraries and plugins.

## Live Demo

You can see a live demo of this setup by including the following snippet in your HTML:

```html
<style>
  #editor {
    height: 300px;
  }

  .ner.person {
    background-color: #e6f7d4;
  }

  .ner.place {
    background-color: #d4e6f1;
  }

  .ner.organization {
    background-color: #f8d7da;
  }

  .ner.date {
    background-color: #fff3cd;
  }

  .ner.url {
    background-color: #fff3cd;
  }

  .ner.currency {
    background-color: red;
  }

  .ner.value {
    background-color: pink;
  }

  .ner.email {
    background-color: blue;
  }

  .ner.atMention {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  .ner {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 20;
  }
</style>

<div id="editor">John Doe met Jane Smith at the Eiffel Tower in Paris on 2023-08-15. 
John is planning to visit his favorite restaurant, Le Gourmet Bistro, 
which is located at 123 Rue de la Paix, Paris, France. 
He booked the reservation through www.gourmetbistro.com and paid â‚¬100 for the meal.

Jane's email address is jane.smith@example.com and she is working on a new project at Tech Innovations Inc.
They both plan to attend the Global Tech Conference in New York on 2023-09-12.

During their conversation, John mentioned his favorite investment is in $5000 worth of Tesla, Inc. stocks. 
Jane said she saw a new article about Apple Inc. and plans to check it out later on her phone.

John also asked Jane if she saw the post from @TechGiant about the latest tech trends.</div>

## Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and ES6 modules

## How It Works

1. **Ace Editor**: The Ace editor is embedded in a `div` element with the ID `editor`. It provides a lightweight and feature-rich code editor.

2. **NLP Entity Recognition**: Using the [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) library, we perform natural language processing (NLP) to recognize entities like persons, places, dates, and more. These entities are highlighted based on the patterns defined in the `patterns` object.

3. **Custom Highlighting**: You can define new patterns in the `patterns` object to match various types of entities (like phone numbers, URLs, etc.). The `highlightWords` function highlights these entities in the editor.

4. **CSS Styling**: The `.ner` class and its variations (like `.ner.person`, `.ner.date`, etc.) are used to apply custom background colors to different types of entities.

5. **Live Updates**: Every time you make a change in the editor, the `change` event is triggered, and the `highlightWords` function is called to update the highlighted entities based on the current content.

## Customization

You can easily customize this setup by:

* **Modifying the Patterns**: Add, remove, or modify entity patterns in the `patterns` object.
* **Changing the Styles**: Update the CSS styles in the `<style>` tag to change how different entities are highlighted.
* **Using Other NLP Libraries**: You can replace the `compromise` library with other versions of `compromise` for your language.
